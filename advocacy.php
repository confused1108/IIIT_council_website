    <p>The council serves as the voice of Information Technology (IT) landscape. Most of the technologically developed nations are now of the interest to protect their domestic companies at the expense of foreign competitors leading to formulation of policies that compel multinational companies to move part or whole of their business to a countryâ€™s borders as a precondition for market access. This can include various forms of localization such as processing data at a national data center, purchase or manufacture locally, or transfer intellectual property to a domestic competitor. The Make in India initiative of our Government comes at the right time that aligns with the global move of forced localization. <br><br>In the face of forced localization the council argues upon the immediate and future needs of the IT sector in various industry segments and societal setup while taking up the industry oriented initiatives required that promotes a healthy innovation ecosystem both at national and global level.<br><br>In this direction the council helps weave the potential of each member institution in coordinating their technical initiatives, provide industry intelligence, develop industry ready workforce, advocate with policy makers in the government, promote the usage and image of IT products and provide opportunities to meet and exchange ideas.
