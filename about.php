    <p>The beginning of Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs) could be traced back to 1992, when Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) contemplated setting up of advanced information technology institutes in the likes of IIMs and IITs in different locations of India. Subsequently in 1995, Government of India based on a report prepared by All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) comprising eminent academicians, policy makers, and professionals decided on establishing such national centres. Presently there are 20 IIITs with focus on Information Technology (IT), IT enabled Management, Design and Manufacturing. Five of them are established, funded and managed by the MHRD, Government of India and the rest are set up on the Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) model funded by the central government, respective state governments and industry partners in the ratio of 50:35:15. <br><br>The Indian Institutes of Information Technology Bill, 2014<a href="http://mhrd.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/IIIT.pdf"> ( Click here)</a>, passed by the Parliament on December 1, 2014 aims at improving quality of human resources, at par with global standards, within the IT sector. The bill also grants the status of Institutes of National Importance (INI) upon the four IIITs in Allahabad, Gwalior, Jabalpur and Kancheepuram. Subsequently, the Indian Institutes of Information Technology (Public-Private Partnership) Act, 2017 notified in the Gazette of India confers the status of INI to 15 IIITs set up on the PPP model in Vadodara, Guwahati, Sri City, Kota, Tiruchirapalli, Kalyani, Una, Sonepat, Lucknow, Kottayam, Senapati (Manipur), Dhawad, Pune, Nagpur and Ranchi.<br><br>In addition to offering Bachelor degree (BE/B.Tech.) by all IIITs, some also offer courses leading to Integrated Post-Graduate (B.Tech.+M.Tech./MBA), Post-Graduate (M.Tech.) and Doctoral research (PhD) in various branches of IT and extensions of IT. Admissions to their Bachelor and IPG programmes are through JEE-Main and M.Tech. is through CCMT.</p>
