    <p>Education plays a key role in enabling the socio-economic development of a nation and offers a competitive advantage to its citizens in a global scenario. It is important to note that, education today is not limited to isolated domains and  the society requires its stake holders to acquire skills across multiple domains.  In this context, the government has established several new IIITs and positioned IIITs in the area of IT education to train techno-managers, information technologists etc. synergizing growth and interaction between disciplines. IIITs also foster education by running training programmes for faculty, students and unemployed graduates in fundamental areas as well as on the cutting edge technologies in addition to the regular programmes offered on its campuses.
